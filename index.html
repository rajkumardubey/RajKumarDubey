                <h3 class="center about-me-focus-text">dynamic, disciplined and innovative</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;I started my journey as a Java/J2EE Developer which really gave me a boost to my career. It was an amazing
                    learning experience to understand and work in multiple roles right from solving technical problems to
                    interacting with the clients and building a meaningful relationship. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;Almost 4 years of experience leading and contributing to prooducts across a variety of sectors and organizational
                    types, has instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity, curiosity, humility and courage. Every
                    phase gave me an opportunity to learn, And I took the ownership and have shown the positive approach
                    towards. This had made me a person, what I am. I approach software production with equal doses of empathy
                    and strategy. Empathy helps me to best align contributors, stakeholders and end-users; strategy helps
                    me to promote sustainability and to address compounding costs and benefits. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;My passion is performance, while fixing a problem why not do it in the most resilient and fastest way possible?
                    Solving a problem is my first love, and code is just a way to do that... solving it while being as correct,
                    extensible and efficient as possible is even better, and how it should always be done. Efficiency is
                    a high bar, one that should never be attainable. Everything can always be faster. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;I am driven by curiosity to learn, which keeps me moving to the great heights. I feel that I've learned most
                    by reading and doing, but overall it's such a small portion of what's out there. I still consider myself
                    a student and continue upgrading myself and believe in moving forward. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;I also love motivating people and help them achieve great things.
